Welcome! I am an international Master student in Mathematics and Physics pursuing a Double Degree between the Technical University of Munich and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Currently I am also a student research assistent working on the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data using tools from modern mathematics and deep learning in the lab of Antonio Scialdone at the Helmhotz Centre for Environment and Health in Munich. Prior to my Master studies, I completed my Bachelor degree with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Physics at the Technical University of Munich including an exchange term at the National University of Singapore. In addition to my academic background, I also possess working experience in industry which I could gather during a period of 2 years as a working student at Robert Bosch GmbH with a field of activity in Data Science for logistics.

Since I expect to complete my studies in fall 2023 I am actively looking for a PhD position with a foucs on learning systems.
