description: 'In recent years, gene regulatory networks have become an essential resource for modelling cellular processes. Single-cell transcriptomics are a promising technique for providing data to infer such networks. Several benchmarking studies have been published in the last years, comparing the statistical performance of the algorithms with metrics, such as area under the curve metrics. However, such metrics can not guarantee to sufficiently capture the algorithms ability to correctly infer the topology of the ground truth gene regulatory network, which can be of high interest for certain biologically meaningful downstream analysis tasks on the inferred gene regulatory networks. We extend the current best practice for benchmarking statistical performance of gene regulatory network inference by a three step pipeline that also captures meaningful topological properties and the algorithms ability to detect network hubs. For this purpose, we sample a cohort of structurally controlled, synthetic datasets and use experimental data from four different organisms to assess the performance on. In the resulting networks, we detect algorithm and datatype specific trends and identify the best performing algorithm for each step of our pipeline. Our benchmarks can be used as a quantitative basis for further optimization of gene regulatory network inference algorithms.'
